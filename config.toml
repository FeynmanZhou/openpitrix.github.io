The multiple clouds are usually from different provides, resulting shadow IT becomes a reality again in cloud era. Therefore, how to manage and automate multi-cloud environment becomes an emerging requirement, especially for application management. Moreover, it is challenging to create one stop store that manages different types of applications, including traditional application (or called monolithic application), microservice application and serverless application. OpenPitrix is such a platform to solve these problems."

Meanwhile, developer does not need to program for moving a traditional application into cloud which reduces development effort from months to days or even hours."
