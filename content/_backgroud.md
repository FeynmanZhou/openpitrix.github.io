## Motivation

The project originates from [QingCloud AppCenter](https://appcenter.qingcloud.com) which helps developers to create cloud-based enterprise applications in a few days and sell them on the center. In addition, the learning curve of how to [develop such applications](https://appcenter-docs.qingcloud.com/developer-guide/) is extremely low. Usually it takes a couple of hours for a developer to understand the working flow. Since QingCloud AppCenter was launched, many customers and partners have been asking us if it supports IaaS other than QingCloud such as AWS, Vmware. That is where the project comes from.
