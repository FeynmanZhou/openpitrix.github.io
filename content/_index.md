# OpenPitrix

OpenPitrix is an Open-source framework for package, deployment, orchestration and management enterprise applications into multiple cloud environments including QingCloud, AWS, OpenStack, Kubernetes and etc.

Pitrix [‘paitriks] means the matrix of PaaS and IaaS which makes it easy to develop, deploy, manage applications including PaaS on various runtime environments, i.e., Pitrix = PaaS + IaaS + Matrix. It also means a matrix that contains endless (PI - the Greek letter “π”) applications.


##Why OpenPitrix?

In the Cloud era, all enterprise applications should be run on different cloud computing platforms, no matter the traditional or the microservice applications. OpenPitrix is born for resolving this problem.

## OpenPitrix Features

* Compatible with Most Applications
By adopting the distributed configuration management and abstracting the meta configuration information, OpenPitrix is compatible with most applications, including the monolithic, distributed, microservice and etc.

* Support Multiple Cloud Platforms
Adopting the plug-in style development framework to abstract the interface of current mainstream cloud platform, reducing the complexity for developers.
Public cloud platforms supported: AWS, GCE, Azure, QingCloud and etc.Private cloud platforms supported: Kubernetes, OpenStack, QingCloud and etc.

* Build with Microservice Architecture
Use the microservice architecture to break applications into more manageable pieces for faster deployment and update cycles. Smaller modules allow each application service to be deployed, updated and managed independently.

* Reduce Complexity
Dramatically reducing the complexity of the cloud applications’ development, deployment and operation through the declarative template specifications.
