# OpenPitrix

OpenPitrix is an open-source system to package, deploy and manage different types of applications including traditional application, microservice application and serverless applications into multiple cloud environment such as AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, QingCloud, OpenStack, VMWare etc.

Pitrix [‘paitriks] means the matrix of PaaS and IaaS which makes it easy to develop, deploy, manage applications including PaaS on various runtime environments, i.e., Pitrix = PaaS + IaaS + Matrix. It also means a matrix that contains endless (PI - the Greek letter “π”) applications.

## Why OpenPitrix?

Nowadays cloud computing is widely adopted in enterprise organizations. Furthermore, most of enterprises have multi-cloud strategy for certain reasons. The multiple clouds are usually from different providers, resulting shadow IT becomes a reality again in cloud era. Therefore, how to manage and automate multi-cloud environment becomes an emerging requirement, especially for application management. Moreover, it is challenging to create one stop store that manages different types of applications, including traditional application (or called monolithic application), microservice application, and serverless application which is increasingly hot recently. OpenPitrix is such a platform to solve these problems.

## OpenPitrix Features

* Compatible with Most Applications
By adopting the distributed configuration management and abstracting the meta configuration information, OpenPitrix is compatible with most applications, including the monolithic, distributed, microservice and etc.

* Support Multiple Cloud Platforms
Adopting the plug-in style development framework to abstract the interface of current mainstream cloud platform, reducing the complexity for developers.
Public cloud platforms supported: AWS, GCE, Azure, QingCloud and etc.Private cloud platforms supported: Kubernetes, OpenStack, QingCloud and etc.

* Build with Microservice Architecture
Use the microservice architecture to break applications into more manageable pieces for faster deployment and update cycles. Smaller modules allow each application service to be deployed, updated and managed independently.

* Reduce Complexity
Dramatically reducing the complexity of the cloud applications’ development, deployment and operation through the declarative template specifications.
